This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in JavaScript related to null value handling. The `foo` function aims to add two numbers but incorrectly handles null inputs. The solution demonstrates a robust way to handle nulls and undefined inputs, ensuring the function behaves predictably in all scenarios.  The bug is in how the null values are handled in the conditional statement and the return value.  The solution provides a more robust approach using the nullish coalescing operator or explicit checks to address these issues.
